## Project Description

Currently at Sparta Global the resource management team are sending out emails to prospective clients with a PDF attachment of the Spartans they believe would suit the potential client. The issue with this was that, full form PDF documents with Spartan information are too much for clients to read. Worst case scenario, the emails with the PDFs attached do not even get past the potential clients email security. All in all, the efforts of the resource team are wasted.

In order to combat this, the resource management team having been sending out brief PDF documents to clients with just the important details. This has shown an increase in the responses recieved from these email campaigns. Sparta Global would like to continue this, and send out brief PDF documents however there is still the issue of getting past potential clients email security.

Sparta Global would like create a portal system which would display all Spartan profiles. This would be web based which the Resource teams can use to send url links to Spartan profiles as opposed to attaching PDF documents.
